This approach minimizes risk, maximizes uptime, and gives users peace of mind knowing the system operates as intended." },

This isn’t about trusting vague promises; it’s about trusting a system purposefully built for stability and fairness.

Whether you're exploring your first loan, navigating repayment options, or just have a question about how it all works, our team is there to guide you through every step. No bots, no copy-paste replies-just real people who understand Bitcoin and care about your success. With Nomacal, you're never on your own-we're with you the whole way." ,text : "While platforms like Aave, Morpho, and Coinbase offer variable-rate loans, those rates are dictated by ever-shifting market liquidity. In times of stress-like liquidity crunches or market-wide deleveraging-interest rates can spike suddenly, triggering margin calls without warning. Worse, these systems have become targets for nation-state actors and coordinated attacks, with reports of entities like North Korea exploiting these liquidity dynamics to force unreliable liquidations. Nomacal takes a fundamentally safer path. With fixed-rate loans and no margin calls, borrowers are shielded from these external manipulations and unpredictable rate shifts. Your repayment terms are locked from day one, so you're never forced to react to market chaos or hidden vulnerabilities in pool-based systems. It's not just about stability—it's about protecting you from the games being played behind the curtain."}

We're grounded in a belief that financial tools should empower, not entangle-that people deserve access to value without surrendering control. This belief isn't a tagline; it's the standard we hold ourselves to, every step of the way." },
        { id: 2, desc: "We're strong because we've chosen a path of clarity. Where others pile on features to impress, we refine and distill. Our design serves the individual, not the institution. It respects time, intelligence, and the need for tools that simply work-with honesty and intention." },
        { id: 3, desc: "We don't try to look like everyone else, because we aren't. While most lending platforms follow a cookie- cutter model-built to scale fast, not last—we've taken the slower, more intentional route. One shaped by real-world needs, not venture capital expectations. One that listens first, and builds with care." },
        { id: 4, desc: "Our strength lies in alignment-with our users, with our values, and with a future where people don't have to trade their beliefs for liquidity. We exist not to impress the market, but to serve a purpose. That's what sets us apart-and that's what makes us strong." }

We believe that access to value should not come at the cost of freedom, nor should the need for liquidity force people to choose between short-term needs and long-term conviction." },
        { id: 2, desc: "Bitcoin represents self-sovereignty-the radical idea that individuals can hold and secure their own value without permission. But what happens when life demands flexibility? When opportunities arise or unexpected needs appear? Traditional finance says: sell. Nomacal says: HODL." },

One that says you can meet life where it is without letting go of what you believe in. You can access cash without compromising your principles, your vision, or your future. Simple terms, built with intention, for people who think long-term." },

In a world where people are told to trust third parties with their wealth, we believe in a different path—one that keeps security in the hands of the user while allowing for flexibility and ease of use." },

We don't overcomplicate the process; instead, we focus on creating an experience that's both robust and accessible. It's a system that gives our users control over their Bitcoin without the burden of managing cumbersome or technical complexities." },

We understand that each user's needs are unique-whether they're a cautious saver, an active trader, or someone in need of advanced, enterprise-grade security. As such, we are committed to expanding our custody solutions in the near future to meet the diverse requests and risk appetites of our growing community. Our vision is to provide a range of options that cater to every user's comfort level, so they can access liquidity while knowing their assets are protected in the way that feels right for them." },
